# Collaby - Frontend

Collaby is a collaborative application that allows users to create and join rooms, assign and manage tasks, chat with others in the room, and collaborate on a word editor in real-time. The front-end of this application is built using React, Chakra UI, and Socket.io.

## Features

1. **Room Creation & Joining:** Users can create or join rooms to interact with others in a shared space.
2. **Task Assignment & Management:** Users can assign tasks to each other and mark them complete.
3. **Chat Functionality:** Real-time chat for users in the same room using Socket.io.
4. **Collaborative Word Editor:** A text editor using React-Quill for real-time editing by multiple users.

## Tech Stack

-   **React.js**: For building the user interface.
-   **Socket.io**: For real-time communication between users in chat and collaborative editing.
-   **Chakra UI**: A component library to design the interface with reusable, responsive components.
